          In this particular case, we are telling Angular to bind to the class property of the DOM element to the value of the expression. Angular will evaluate it like a normal JavaScript expression, and assign the value (positive in this case) to the class property of the div element. <br>
          When you bind to the class property like we did in the example, note that it overrides the existing value of the property. In our example, the "price" class is replaced with the class "positive", instead of appending to the existing value of the property. You can notice this for yourself if you inspect the rendered HTML in the browser. Be careful about this if you bind directly to the class property.
